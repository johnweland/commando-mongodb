A MongoDB provider for discord.js-commando

## About
This is a slight rework of the [commando-provider-mongo][commando-provider-mongo] package by [Dizzy][Dizzy]. This rework is designed to work with [discord.js][discord.js] v12 and later. If you are running an earlier version of [discord.js][discord.js] please use [Dizzy's][Dizzy] [commando-provider-mongo][commando-provider-mongo] package.

[Commando](https://github.com/discordjs/Commando) is the official framework for [discord.js][discord.js], to allow for easy development of discord bot commands and functionality.

## Installation
```bash
npm install --save mongodb commando-mongodb
```

## Usage
```js
const MongoClient = require('mongodb').MongoClient;
const MongoDBProvider = require('commando-provider-mongo');

...

client.setProvider(
	MongoClient.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017').then(client => new MongoDBProvider(client, '<db_name>'))
).catch(console.error);

...
```
